# Assignment: Create a Simple Web Page Using HTML

In this assignment, you'll create a basic web page using plain HTML that displays information about yourself.

## Instructions:

1. **Create a New HTML File:**
   - Start by creating a new HTML file, named `index.html`, in your text editor or IDE (such as VS Code).

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - Set up the basic structure of your HTML document with the following elements:
     - A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top.
     - An opening `<html>` tag and a closing `</html>` tag.
     - Inside the `<html>` tags, include a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section.

3. **Title and Head Section:**
   - Within the `<head>` section, include a `<title>` tag with your name as the title of the page.
   - Optionally, you can add metadata, such as `<meta charset="UTF-8">` to set the character encoding.

4. **Add Content to the Body:**
   - In the `<body>` section, add the following elements:
     - **Heading:** Use an `<h1>` tag to display your name as the main title of the page.
     - **Image:** Include at least one image using the `<img>` tag. You can link to an image online or use one stored locally in your project folder.
     - **Link:** Add at least one hyperlink using the `<a>` tag. This could link to your GitHub profile, LinkedIn, or any other page of your choice.
     - **Small Bio:** In a paragraph element `<p>`, write a small paragraph with whatever you want to share about yourself.
     - **Bullet Point List:** Create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with at least three items.
     - **Numbered List:** Create an ordered list (`<ol>`) with at least three items.

5. **Additional HTML Element:**
   - Explore other HTML tags and include at least one additional element not listed above. For example, you might include a `<blockquote>`, `<table>`, or `<hr>` tag.

6. **Publish Your Web Page:**
   - Once your HTML file is complete, commit your changes.
   - Using GitHub Pages, deploy your website on the internet.

7. **Submission:**
   - Turn in both your repository URL as well as your deployment link on Canvas.
